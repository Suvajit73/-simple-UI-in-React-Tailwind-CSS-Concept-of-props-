I built a simple UI in React + Tailwind CSS to go deeper into core concepts:
🔹 Structured the page into multiple reusable components (Navbar, Section, MainContent, Left/Right panels, Cards)
 🔹 Passed data from App → Section → MainContent → RightSecContent → Cards using props
 🔹 Used .map() to render dynamic card components from a users array
 🔹 Practiced clean component composition and prop drilling to understand how data flows in a React app
 🔹 Added basic styling and layout with Tailwind for a responsive, modern look
